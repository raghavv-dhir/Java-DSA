Multiple Inheritance
Definition:
A type of inheritance where a class inherits from more than one parent class.

Status in Java:
Java does NOT support multiple inheritance with classes â€” to avoid the Diamond Problem (ambiguity when two parents have the same method).
Instead, Java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces.
