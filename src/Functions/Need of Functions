Q1. Why we need functions in Java?
Ans: Due to following reasons:
     1. Code Reusability
        Instead of writing the same code again and again, you can write it once inside a function
        and reuse it wherever needed.

     2. Modular Code (Organized and Clean)
        Functions help break a big task into small, manageable parts (modules), which makes
        code easier to read and maintain.

     3. Easy Debugging & Maintenance
        If there's a bug, you can easily check inside the specific function instead of searching
         through the whole program.

     4. Avoid Redundancy (DRY Principle)
        DRY = Don't Repeat Yourself.
        Functions help avoid repeating code, which saves time and reduces errors.

     5. Improves Testing
        Functions can be tested independently. You can write unit tests for a specific function
        without needing to test the entire program.

     6. Supports OOP Concepts
        In Java, which is object-oriented, methods/functions are used inside classes to define
        object behaviors.
